README for other files (not my report)

1) ps.py is my ps script. It can be run using: python ps.py name_of_memory_file

2) lsof.py is my lsof script. It can be run using: python lsof.py name_of_memory_file pid_no

3) gen_lsof.sh is a script that generates lsof.txt. This should not need to be run, but in
   the event that you want to, it is simply ./gen_lsof.sh

4) lsof.txt is the output of my lsof program for all of the processes that appeared in
   my ps output. The header of each table is printed for each pid number, so for processes
   that do not have any open files, the only thing it will print is:
Process Name    PID     FD      Mode    Type    Device No   Size    Inode Number    File Name                       
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



   That is to be expected, as lsof was designed to be run on one process at a time. PID values will
   only be printed for processes that have open files.
